# Curating Your Experience

How you curate your skyline is on you. [Blacksky](https://bsky.app/profile/blacksky.app) recommends the following best practices:
- Do not use the #AddToBlacksky and #Blacksky hashtags unnecessarily. Using hashtags in Bluesky makes your posts easy to search for, but also allows for misuse.
- You only need to use #AddToBlacksky once to have your posts shown in the feed. We recommend deleting that initial post after you are on the feed in order to make it harder to search for and be used accidentally or maliciously.
- We recommend subscribing to and performing a “Block All” using the Green List Feed.

If you’ve updated your personal moderation settings to hide sexual content but it’s still coming through the feeds, you can report the post to the Blacksky Moderation Service to have it removed if it’s spam or have them label it as sexual content.

You must be subscribed to the Blacksky Moderation Service to do so. To learn more, see How Do I Subscribe to the Blacksky Moderation Service Labeler?
