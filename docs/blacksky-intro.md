# Introduction
Blacksky Algorithms builds open-source, community-driven infrastructure for decentralized social media. Our mission is to empower communities with tools for safety, governance, and control over their online spaces. This documentation is designed to help new users understand what Blacksky offers and how to get started with our feeds and moderation services.

This website contains information for both technical and non-technical users. We will continue to add and update the website, as more packages are created and updated.
